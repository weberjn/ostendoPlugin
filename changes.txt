Fixed that Logdirs from memento were added each time the view opened.

2016-04-07 1.0.4
set Window -> Preferences -> Target Platform -> Edit -> Environment -> set Architecture to "x86_64".
after export works under X64 now.

2014-11-27 1.0.3 

Fixed nasty bug:

Path must include project and resource name: /testTiny.sent.log.xml
	at org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert.isLegal(Assert.java:63)
	at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.newResource(Workspace.java:2137)
	at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Container.getFile(Container.java:208)
	
Fix is to return in OstendoOutputStorage.getFullPath()
an non-null Path.
